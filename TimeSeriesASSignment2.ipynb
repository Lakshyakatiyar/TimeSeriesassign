    "1.Time-dependent seasonal components:\n",
    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to seasonal patterns in time series data that change over time. Unlike static seasonal patterns that remain constant, time-dependent seasonal components evolve or vary with time, reflecting changes in seasonality patterns over different periods."

These factors can lead to shifts or variations in seasonal patterns over time."

    "Autoregression models are used to model the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations (autoregressive terms) of the same time series. They are commonly used in time series analysis and forecasting to capture temporal dependencies and predict future values based on past observations."

    "To make predictions for future time points using autoregression models, the model parameters (coefficients) are estimated using historical data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to forecast future values by recursively applying the autoregressive equation with the previously observed values."

    "A moving average (MA) model is a time series model that represents the relationship between an observation and a linear combination of past white noise error terms. Unlike autoregressive models that depend on past observations, MA models depend on past forecast errors. They are used to capture short-term fluctuations or random shocks in the data."

    "A mixed autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model combines both autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components to capture both the temporal dependencies in past observations and the short-term fluctuations or random shocks. A mixed ARMA model differs from AR or MA models by incorporating both autoregressive and moving average terms to model the time series data. This allows for more flexibility in capturing different patterns and structures in the data.\n",
